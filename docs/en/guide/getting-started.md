# üìù Deployment Guide

## üì¶ Check system

Please confirm that your system language set is UTF8, otherwise enter `dpkg-reconfigure locales` to configure the
language.

Please make sure that the memory of your server is greater than `1G`, otherwise PM2 will restart indefinitely.

::: tip tip
The base operating load is approximately 600MB of memory per receiver + transmitter (one platform).
Receivers and transmitters can be deployed separately, but the database must be shared.

## ü•û Automatic installation

If you are using a brand new server, you can use the following shell to try to automatically install this project.

```shell

```

::: warning
If you use Docker to run your robot, you may encounter missing dependencies. Sometimes we forget to package new
dependencies.

:::

## ü•Ω Manual installation

- Use `pip uninstall llm-kira` to uninstall the old kernel.

- Use `pip uninstall llmkira` to uninstall plugin dev tools.(or will cause conflict)
