# üìù Deployment Guide

## üì¶ Check system

Please confirm that your system language set is UTF8, otherwise enter `dpkg-reconfigure locales` to configure the
language.

Please make sure that the memory of your server is greater than `1G`.

::: tip
The base operating load is approximately 600MB of memory per receiver + transmitter (one platform).
Receivers and transmitters can be deployed separately, but the database must be shared.
:::

## üì¶ Quick Start

Read the [üßÄ Deployment Documentation](https://llmkira.github.io/Docs/) for more information.

::: warning Test Before You Run
Please use `python3 start_sender.py` `python3 start_receiver.py` to test whether it can run normally.

If you are using Docker, you can use `docker-compose up -f docker-compose.yml` to test whether it can run normally in
front.

Run `python3 start_tutorial.py` to check the tutorial.
:::

### ü•£ Docker

Build Hub: [sudoskys/llmbot](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/sudoskys/llmbot/general)

#### Automatic Docker/Docker-compose installation and operation

If you are using a brand new server, you can use the following shell to try to automatically install this project.

This script will automatically install the required services and map ports using Docker methods, if you have
deployed `redis`, `rabbitmq`, `mongodb`.

Please modify the `docker-compose.yml` file yourself.

```shell

curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LLMKira/Openaibot/main/deploy.sh | bash
```

#### Manual Docker-compose installation

```shell
git clone https://github.com/LlmKira/Openaibot.git
cd Openaibot
cp .env.exp .env && nano .env
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d

```

### üçî Shell

To manually start using Pm2

```shell
git clone https://github.com/LlmKira/Openaibot.git
cd Openaibot
pip install poetry
# poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true # !! if you want to use virtualenv
poetry install
cp .env.exp .env && nano .env
apt install npm -y && npm install pm2 && pm2 start pm2.json
pm2 monit

```

To restart the program use `pm2 restart pm2.json`.

::: tip
It is recommended that you use Docker Compose for deployment. Or use Docker to run the database and pm2 to run the
robot.

The Docker image uses pm2-runtime to run the robot, the same way you use the shell.
:::

## ü•Ω Manual installation

- Use `pip uninstall llm-kira` to uninstall the old kernel.

- Use `pip uninstall llmkira` to uninstall plugin dev tools.(or will cause conflict)

- Make sure your Python version is 3.9 or above.

- Install Docker

::: tip
To install Docker, please refer to [Official Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)

To install Docker Compose, please refer to [Official Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

Or [blog post](https://krau.top/posts/install-docker-one-key)

Windows users can install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

**Please make sure your database is within a bridge/LAN, otherwise the link will fail.**
:::

At this point you can try using [Docker to run the robot](#ü•£-docker), if you don‚Äôt want to use Docker you can continue
reading.

### üç´ Install Redis

There are two ways to install the cache database, you can choose one of them.

#### Install via command line

```bash
# Install Redis
apt-get install redis
systemctl enable redis.service --now
```

#### Install via Docker

```bash
docker pull redis:latest
docker run -d -p 6379:6379 \
     --name redis \
     redis:latest
```

::: tip tip
It is recommended that you add a password to prevent the database from being exposed to the public network.
:::

### ü•ï Install MongoDB

#### Install via shell

Please refer to the article to install MongoDB

https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-mongodb-on-ubuntu-20-04

https://www.runoob.com/mongodb/mongodb-linux-install.html

https://www.prisma.io/dataguide/mongodb/setting-up-a-local-mongodb-database

::: tip Here!
It is recommended that you add a password to prevent the database from being exposed to the public network.
The default configuration of the project is `mongodb://admin:8a8a8a@localhost:27017/`, you can configure it yourself in
.env.

If you installed Mongodb through the shell, please use the `mongosh` command to enter the database to create a user and
query the DSN.
:::

#### Install via Docker

```bash
docker pull mongo:latest
docker run -d -p 27017:27017 \
   --name mongo \
   -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME="admin" \
   -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD="8a8a8a" \
   mongo:latest

```

### üê∞ Install RabbitMQ

There are two ways to install the cache database, you can choose one of them.

#### Install via command line

To install RabbitMQ from the command line, please refer
to [Official Documentation](https://www.rabbitmq.com/install-debian.html)
or [blog post](https://www.leeks.info/zh_CN/latest/Linux_Notes/rabbitmq/RabbitMQ.html)

Please make sure your Openai API Endpoint is complete.
:::

For a list of all Openai models supported except the `0314` series, please refer
to [Openai API](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/).

Supports two modes: `FunctionCall` and `ToolCall`.

Users can apply for API Key at [Openai](https://beta.openai.com/).

User data and usage are recorded in a Mongodb database.

### üçü Unofficial backend

If you use [One-API](https://github.com/songquanpeng/one-api) as a shunt and use a model that does not support
functions, then you may not be able to use some based on
Function of Func Calling.
Such as functions, file support, etc.

If you're using Azure, make sure the version you're using supports the functions.

This program can be used without `functions`
Run single point reply, but when sending the request, it will
have `functions: Optional[List[Function]]` `function_call: Optional[str]` parameter.
